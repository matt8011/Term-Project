# CSC 212 Group Final Project: Trie
*By Matt Kyle, Evan O'Neil, Jacob Pierce, and Nitish Salvi*

# Overview
This project utilizes a Trie to implement an autocomplete function in C++. The user will interact with this program via command line arguments (CLAs) and user inputs in a Ubuntu terminal. The following functions are implemented.
- Search
- Insert
- Print to File
- Repeated Words
  
# Setup
This program requires C++ to run alongside Ubuntu to test the program. 
### Installing an IDE
To properly run this program, an IDE should be installed. A few local IDEs we recommend are *CLion* and *VSCode*. If you are unable to utilize a local IDE then you can use *cs50.dev* as an Online IDE.
### Installing g++
Run the following commands:
**sudo apt-get update** and
**sudo apt-get install g++**
### Downloading a Library
This can be done by implementing articles, dictionaries, and other inputs of characters in a .txt format. An example text is provided in the **______ folder** named **_____.txt.**

# Compiling
1. Download the following files from this repository: **main.cpp**, **Trie.cpp**, **Trie.h**. These are located in the **blank** folder. 
1.a. Make sure to also download a library.
2. Open your IDE and navigate to the folder where you stored your files with the CLA "cd".
3. Compile the program using this CLA: **g++ main.cpp Trie.cpp -o *prog***.
4. Run the program with the following CLA: **./prog *inputFile.txt***.
5. Follow the terminal commands.
